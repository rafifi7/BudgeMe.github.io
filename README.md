# BudgeMe Budget Planner

BudgeMe is a budget planner that provides a breakdown of your spending through percentages based on a total budget for a given certain time period. It visualizes these percentages of your budget through use of a pie chart. It then gives you an analysis of your percentage of spending by reporting your percentage spent on each category and how of your budget you have left.

## Features

- Allows for the user to modify the time period that the budget spans
- Interactive user interface allows for input of spending for time period
- Updates budget remaining as user inputs money spent
- Displays a pie chart based on user data
- Writes an analysis of your spending habits


### About our group
Our group of four made this budgeting app for our first hackathon. We began by creating the idea of the budget planner for the hackathon and began deciding which language we would decide to use. We ended up using javascript to make our webiste. This was quite a challenge because we as a collective had very minimal experience in javascript, HTML, and CSS. We began splitting up the work to try to work as efficiently as possible and this is our final product. We broke the work into design, code, and styling all split between the four of us.
